//! The control certificate of `doc/adr-structure-dominator-tree.md` §3.
//!
//! The rendered body is read back as a control graph over block occurrences,
//! and that graph must equal the function's CFG: every block occurs, every
//! occurrence leaves exactly the way its block's terminator says, and a
//! rendered test is the block's own test. The reader here is a small
//! interpreter of C control that knows nothing about how the tree was built,
//! which is what makes it a certificate rather than a re-derivation.
